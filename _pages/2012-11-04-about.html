<p>Hi There, my name is Sean Choe.</p>
<p>I've moved from South Korea to Bay Area on 2013, and working as a UX/Graphic designer + iOS/Web Developer. I'm living peacefully in a small city called Belmont, with my lovely wife.</p>
<p>I love technology, music, movies and art. Also interested in entrepreneurship and startups.</p>
<p>I also enjoy drawing comics and caricatures as hobbies.</p>

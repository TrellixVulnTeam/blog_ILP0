Cut to the chase, No. I don't think so.

There has been a lot of controversies about Apple's new 2016 MacBook Pro and Apple in general, specially comparing to Microsoft's Surface Studio announcement on the day earlier. Although some of them are valid complains, I found most of them sound absurd to me. I will explain why.

###Is Touch Bar just a gimmick?
No, I think it's a great alternative to function keys.

Is Touch Bar a necessary tool for pro users? It might not be. We wouldn't know until we actually use it for a while. I admit, showing emojis and DJ'ing for the demo was not a great idea. I think Apple tried to show the possibilities, not saying that pro DJs will actually use Touch Bar to mix music.

Think about it. Who really uses function keys? I only use them for changing things like volume and brightness control. Maybe some windows users are using them as a part of keyboard shortcuts, but most of the Mac users don't. Is having a dynamic touch screen better than printing icons on the function keys? Of course, it makes much more sense.

###Would looking down to tap Touch Bar bothering?
No, it wouldn't! Touch Bar is located less than an inch away from the bottom of the screen. Comparing to the old models, Apple shifted up the keyboard closer to the screen in the new MacBook Pro. Touch Bar is kind of like blended area between the screen and the keyboard.

###Should Apple have just made the whole keyboard touch screen?
You should've gotten it by now. My answers to all of these questions are no.

Apple's Phil Schiller did a [great interview](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-macbook-pro-new-philip-schiller-interview-phil-iphone-ios-criticism-a7393156.html) about the new MacBook Pro with Independent. His quote:
> ...The new MacBook Pro is a product that celebrates that it is a notebook, this shape that has been with us for the last 25 years is probably going to be with us for another 25 years because there’s something eternal about the basic notebook form factor.

>You have a surface that you type down on with your hands, with a screen facing you vertically. That basic orientation, that L shape makes perfect sense and won’t go away. The team came up with this idea that you can create a multi-touch surface that’s coplanar with the keyboard and the trackpad but brings a whole new experience into it, one that’s more interactive, with multi-touch.

###Should Apple have just made a touch screen Mac like Surface Studio?
No.

Phil Schiller again:
>We’re steadfast in our belief that there are fundamentally two different products to make for customers and they’re both important. There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications. And that’s that experience. And we want to make those the best in that direction anyone can imagine. We have a long road ahead of us on that.

>Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus. We want to make this the best experience we can dream of in this direction.

>Here’s one example of how they should remain distinct: the Mac from the very first has had a menu bar fixed at the top. It’s core to the identity and the experience you get. But iOS doesn’t have a menu at the top. It never will. The thought of pointing at a menu at the top of an iPhone feels wrong. If you made the Mac a touchscreen you’d have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we’ve looked at that — it’s a bad experience. It’s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad.

###Should Apple have just kept the tactile ESC key?
No.

ESC key does many things. Exiting fullscreen, cancelling an action and so forth. It would make much more sense to make the key dynamic.

###Is going USB-C only a bad idea?
No, I don't think so.

Having to carry the dongles around might be bothering for now. But if they didn't go USB-C ports only this year, When would it be? They would have the same conflicts and controversies even if it were next year. It's the same thing as removing the headphone jack from iPhone. It's obvious that USB-C is thinner, faster and better. All of the peripheral would go USB-C eventually. If you have to do it sooner or later, Why not sooner? It's about saying no, taking risks, and maybe, courage.

###Should Apple have kept MacSafe?
Even [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/02/requiem-for-magsafe) is missing it.

But I think sunsetting MacSafe must have been Apple's intensional decision. Apple's ultimate goal for MacBook must have been making it a true mobile device. What is ultimate mobile device? iPhone. Apple will keep make MacBook lighter and thinner.  Maybe until when it would be light and thin as actual notebook. Do you need MacSafe when you charge iPhone? No. You just charge iPhone while you sleep or work, and you don't plug it in when you use it. Apple's goal for MacBooks is the same. Apple doesn't design out of needs. Their design tells a story about the definition about the product.

###Is Microsoft Surface Studio a revolutionary product?
You know what? I think Surface Studio is actual gimmicky product.

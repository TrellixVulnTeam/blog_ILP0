Don't get me wrong. Although most of my friends know me as a big Apple fan, I don't think Apple is perfect. They are struggling in many areas. Map was an obvious failure on launch, and Apple Music's UI is also facing a lot of controversy. iCloud is not better than other competitors. Apple Watch was only a partial success, and most of all, they failed to communicate with all the professionals who were longing for updates of Mac product lines.

That being said, I didn't understand the rage of people against Apple these days, specially after the new 2016 MacBook Pro announcement. A lot of people compare their announcement with the Microsoft's one on the day before, and say that Microsoft is taking Apple's place of the leader of revolution in the industry. I understand why they are saying so, but I think it's a misunderstanding, rather a self-deception. And here's why.

###Touch Bar
Many people are saying the new Touch Bar is nothing but a gimmick. It's clearly not a revolutionary interface like click wheel or multi touch, but I think it's a necessary change and great execution. Generally speaking, who uses function keys? I almost never use unless when I adjust brightness or volume. 

These are the common complains I'm seeing.

####Who looks down to tap a button?
I'm a part professional developer, and I still look down to type sometimes, specially when I type numbers. And Touch Bar is just less then an inch below the bottom of the screen. The distance got short then the previous model. It's like a separate extension of the screen.

####Why don't they make the whole keyboard a touch screen?


####Give my ESC key back


###Dongles



###Microsoft

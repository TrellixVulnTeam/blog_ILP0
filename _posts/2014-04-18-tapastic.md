![Paperless Sketches]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-04-18-at-11.12.39-PM.png)

You might have heard about [Tapastic](http://tapastic.com). Maybe not.

Tapastic is a web comic service where you can read a lot of great comics on the web or the mobile app. It is founded by my dear friend Chang Kim.

I'm posting my comics there as a series named ["Paperless Sketches"](http://tapastic.com/series/paperless-sketches). The comics I will post there will be just same as the ones I've been posting on my blog here. And I'll keep posting them here too.

If you've been enjoying my comics, Please keep enjoying it!

<p>You might have heard about <a href="http://tapastic.com">Tapastic</a>. Maybe not.</p>
<p>Tapastic is a web comic service where you can read a lot of great comics on the web or the mobile app. It is founded by my dear friend Chang Kim.</p>
<p>I'm posting my comics there as a series named "<a href="http://tapastic.com/series/paperless-sketches">Paperless Sketches</a>". The comics I will post there will be just same as the ones I've been posting on my blog here. And I'll keep posting them here too.</p>
<p>If you've been enjoying my comics, Please keep enjoying it!</p>

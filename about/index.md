Hi There, my name is Sean Choe.

I've moved from South Korea to Bay Area on 2013, and working as a UX/Graphic designer + iOS/Web Developer at a company called ZeroDesktop. I'm living peacefully in a small city called Belmont, with my lovely wife.

I love technology, music, movies and art. Also interested in entrepreneurship and startups.

I also enjoy drawing comics and caricatures as hobbies.

You can know more details about me at my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/seanchoe) and [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/seanchoe).

If you want to email me send it to: sean (at) seanchoe.com

Thank you and hope you enjoy my website!
